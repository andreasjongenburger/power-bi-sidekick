# Power BI Sidekick
Use the external tool Power BI Sidekick to retrieve quick insights on the usage of many objects in your Power BI reports.

### Three components
1. Report pages --> scan through all elements relevant for evaluation from a page perspective.
2. Mini tools --> Ten mini tools addressing different aspects of the report (DAX dependencies, calculation groups, bookmarks, search expressions ...)
3. Documentation --> overviews of the objects that are being used in the report ( tables, columns, measures, bookmarks ...)

Hopefully useful for many alike Power BI developers, just check it out!  
See https://github.com/andreasjongenburger/power-bi-sidekick/wiki/Set-up-and-run-Power-BI-Sidekick for installation instructions.
See https://andreasjongenburger.com/ for an overview of use cases (coming soon).

### Standing on the shoulders of giants

The intention is to share this external tool in the Power BI Community. This fits perfectly given that it is substantially based on community shared content.

Parts of the performance metrics are based on the Vertipaq Analyzer tool created by DAX heroes Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari (https://github.com/sql-bi/VertiPaq-Analyzer).

Another big shout-out is directed to Stephanie Bruno, who created the Power BI Field Finder (https://github.com/stephbruno/Power-BI-Field-Finder). From that project, I took the beautiful idea of visualizing objects that are used in the Power BI reports with svg-miniature-images.

### Licence

Given that Stephanie Bruno's project is shared under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and my usage of code snippets from her tool, Power BI Sidekick will also be shared under the same license.
